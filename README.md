Hi, I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software engineer who's passionate providing value by building performant, scalable and maintainable software. 
With a strong foundation in software development fundamentals and an addiction to constantly improve, 
I thrive in environments where I can take initiatives and tackle challenges that are outside my comfort zone.
